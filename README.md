# Contactlist_using_tkinter
We can store our contact in files and access them whenenver we want through this program.

WE are just importing tkinter module for this program.

I used a file named Docu.txt to store my contact where I can display and see my contact.

I have initialized button for every operations involved in a contact, like Add, Delete, Display, Search

Just save this python file and name a text file as "Docu.txt". Store the file in same location along with the python file.
